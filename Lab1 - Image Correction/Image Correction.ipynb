        "\n",
        "When setting up your development environment for geospatial analysis, it's crucial to install the necessary libraries correctly to avoid common issues. Here are the steps and important notes to guide you through the installation process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Install GDAL\n",
        "To avoid errors related to Visual Studio build files when installing GDAL via pip, it's recommended to use Conda. This method simplifies the installation process by handling binary dependencies:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "conda install -c conda-forge gdal\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Install EarthPy\n",
        "To circumvent dependency errors that might occur when installing EarthPy with Conda, use pip. This ensures that EarthPy and its Python dependencies are installed correctly:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip install earthpy\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Pay Attention to Versioning\n",
        "It's critical to select a Python version that satisfies the requirements of both GDAL, as it relates to GIS, and EarthPy. Ensuring compatibility across these libraries will prevent version conflicts and runtime errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a Python Environment\n",
        "To avoid disrupting your base environment or the default Python distribution, create a dedicated Python or Conda environment with Python versions 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10. This isolation helps manage dependencies more effectively and keeps your system tidy:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "# For Conda\n",
        "conda create -n geospatial python=3.8\n",
        "conda activate geospatial\n",
        "\n",
        "# Alternatively, for Python's venv\n",
        "python -m venv geospatial\n",
        "# Activate the environment as per your OS instructions\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these instructions, you can set up a robust geospatial analysis environment that minimizes common installation issues and fosters a productive development workflow.\n",

        "Haze Removal by Dark Subtraction is a process designed to correct for atmospheric effects that add a constant level of brightness across all pixels in each spectral band of an image. The steps for implementing this method are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Assumption**: The process begins with the assumption that in a haze-free image, some pixels in each band should have brightness values close to zero. However, haze adds a constant brightness to all pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Histogram Analysis**: Histograms of the spectral bands are analyzed. Normally, the lowest significant brightness values should be near zero, but haze shifts these values away from the origin. This shift is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Histogram Shift**: The histograms are adjusted by shifting them to the left, making the minimum significant brightness values approach zero. This adjustment reduces the impact of atmospheric scattering.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Subtractive Bias Calculation**: A subtractive bias is determined for each spectral band based on the minimum brightness value (BV) observed in the histograms. This bias represents the haze effect to be removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Bias Application**: $$BV_{i,j,k} = BV_{i,j,k} - BV_{bias}$$\n",
