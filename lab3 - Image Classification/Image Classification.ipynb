In the context of image classification, MLE helps to quantify the probability of observing the data within each predefined class based on their distinct statistical properties. This method is highly effective for classifying images into categories by comparing the likelihoods of the data under different model parameters, enabling the most probable class assignment.\n","\n","1. **Calculate Class Priors**: Estimate the probability of each class based on the training dataset. This is expressed as:\n","   $$\n","   P(C_k) = \\frac{N_k}{N}\n","   $$\n","   where \\(N_k\\) is the number of samples of class \\(k\\) and \\(N\\) is the total number of samples.\n","\n","2. **Estimate Class-specific Parameters**: For each class, estimate parameters such as the mean \\(\\mu_k\\) and covariance \\(\\Sigma_k\\) of features that describe the distribution of the data:\n","   $$\n","   \\mu_k = \\frac{1}{N_k} \\sum_{x \\in C_k} x\n","   $$\n","   $$\n","   \\Sigma_k = \\frac{1}{N_k} \\sum_{x \\in C_k} (x - \\mu_k)(x - \\mu_k)^T\n","   $$\n","\n","3. **Compute Likelihoods**: For a given test instance \\(x\\), compute the likelihood of that instance belonging to each class using the estimated parameters:\n","   $$\n","   p(x | C_k) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{d/2} |\\Sigma_k|^{1/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} (x - \\mu_k)^T \\Sigma_k^{-1} (x - \\mu_k)\\right)\n","   $$\n","\n","4. **Classify Based on Maximum Likelihood**: Assign the class label to each test instance based on the highest likelihood, which can be calculated as:\n","   $$\n","   \\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_{k} P(C_k) \\cdot p(x | C_k)\n","   $$\n","\n","The Naive Bayes classifier is perhaps the most well-known application of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator principle in classification tasks. It assumes that the features in each class are independent, simplifying the computation of likelihoods. While Naive Bayes is popular for its simplicity and efficiency, it is not the only technique that leverages the MLE approach. Other classical alternatives include Logistic Regression, which applies MLE to estimate the parameters that best predict categorical outcomes, and Gaussian Mixture Models, which use MLE to estimate the parameters of multiple Gaussian distributions within the data. Students are encouraged to explore these models to gain a deeper understanding of statistical estimation techniques.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Req- Image Classification for EuroSATallBands\n","Image classification is a key challenge in satellite imaging and remote sensing.

Instructions\n","\n","To ensure a smooth evaluation process, please follow these steps for submitting your work:\n","\n","1. **Prepare Your Submission:** Alongside your main notebook, include any additional files that are necessary for running the notebook successfully. This might include data files, images, or supplementary scripts.\n","\n","2. **Rename Your Files:** Before submission, please rename your notebook to reflect the IDs of the two students working on this project. The format should be `ID1_ID2`, where `ID1` and `ID2` are the student IDs. For example, if the student IDs are `9123456` and `9876543`, then your notebook should be named `9123456_9876543.ipynb`.\n","\n","3. **Check for Completeness:** Ensure that all required tasks are completed and that the notebook runs from start to finish without errors. This step is crucial for a smooth evaluation.\n","\n","4. **Submit Your Work:** Once everything is in order, submit your notebook and any additional files via the designated submission link on Google Classroom **(code: 2yj6e24)**. Make sure you meet the submission deadline to avoid any late penalties.\n","5. Please, note that the same student should submit the assignments for the pair throughout the semester.\n","\n","By following these instructions carefully, you help us in evaluating your work efficiently and fairly **and any failure to adhere to these guidelines can affect your grades**.

(0.5 Marks)\n","   - Accurately splits the dataset into training and testing subsets and clearly shows this split. (1.5 Marks)\n","\n","2. **Feature Extraction (2 Marks)**\n","   - Implements feature extraction appropriately, considering the curse of dimensionality. (1 Mark)\n","   - Extracts and justifies the selection of features relevant to distinguishing the classes. (1 Mark)\n","\n","3. **Implementation of MLE Classifier (3 Marks)**\n","   - Correctly calculates and clearly shows class priors and class-specific parameters. (1 Mark)\n","   - Accurately computes likelihoods using the likelihood equation (probability density function) and classifies based on maximum likelihood. Must clearly show these calculations and explain the choice of likelihood equation. (2 Marks)\n","\n","4. **Model Evaluation and Understanding (3 Marks)**\n","   - Shows **confusion matrix** and correctly calculates and clearly shows the calculations for Accuracy and Average F1 Score. (1 Mark)\n","   - **Comparison amongst your peers.** Compares the model's performance against those of peers to identify strengths and areas for improvement.
